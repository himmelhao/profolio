# Full-Width Background Fix

## ❗ Problem Identified & Fixed

You were absolutely right! The issue was that **background sections were not extending to full screen width** on wide displays. While the content containers were updated, the background colors (like the grey sections) were still constrained and only covering the left portion of the screen.

## 🔧 Root Causes Fixed

### 1. **CSS Flexbox Centering Conflict**
- **Problem**: `index.css` had `body { display: flex; place-items: center; }` which was centering the entire app
- **Fix**: Removed flexbox centering and set proper width constraints

### 2. **Section Background Width Constraints**  
- **Problem**: Sections with background colors were inside containers that limited their width
- **Fix**: Used viewport width techniques to break backgrounds out to full screen

## ✅ Specific Sections Fixed

### **About Page - Skills Section**
- Grey background (`#f8fafc`) now extends full width
- Content remains properly contained and responsive

### **Projects Page - Other Projects Section**  
- Grey background section now covers entire screen width
- Project grid scales properly across full width

### **Blog Page - Recent Posts Section**
- Background section extends to screen edges
- Content maintains proper spacing and layout

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### **Full-Width Background Technique**
```css
.section-with-background {
  /* Break out of parent container constraints */
  width: 100vw;
  position: relative;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin-left: -50vw;
  margin-right: -50vw;
  
  /* Background extends full width */
  background: #f8fafc;
}

.section-with-background > * {
  /* Content remains contained and responsive */
  max-width: 95vw;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 2rem;
}
```

### **Responsive Content Scaling**
- **Standard screens**: 95% width utilization
- **Large screens (1400px+)**: 90% width utilization  
- **Extra wide (1800px+)**: 85% width utilization
